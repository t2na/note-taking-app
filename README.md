# note-taking-app

An express.js-built application for writing, saving, and deleting notes

### Description
The attached project file(s) are for our nineth challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to write the backend code for an existing note-taking app, where the front end code was already generated for us. The project is simple and intuitive to use. One just needs to write the title and body of a note, then that text is saved to a database file, which allows the note to be saved to a sidebar where it can be accessed again.

This project provided me a great opportunity to text my knowledge of express.js. Refering back to my notes from class, as well as looking up express.js concepts in Google, allowed me to complete the project along with the extra credit, where we added "delete note" functionality to the delete icons that are present in the UI.
